## Challenges
The biggest challenge faced was the issue with the seed file which broke the code. as it was pushed to github and pulled by the entire team, everyones code was broken, and it seemed that the code couldn't be rolled back to a working version.

to get through this, i started from scratch and programmed the website myself. this wouldn't be feasible in client projects, but hopefully these issues wouldn't happen or at very least, we would always be able to rollback to a eariler version of the code.

## Takeaway

In regards to the homework, i had no issues.

In regards to the group project i am worried that an issue like this could happen again and cause all the work the group would have done up to that point to be lost.
